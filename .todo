- automatize CMakeList.txt:
   * NODEPHEADERS for MAC: i think this is only needed for LArSoftReader, currently not used
   * TENSORFLOW stuff
     -> I Think it would be good to have the opportunity of compiling HighLAND with and without tensorflow depending on what the analyzer wants to do (flag variable on CMakeList?)
     -> solution based on the existence of the folder /cvmfs/larsoft.opensciencegrid.org/

- create a pdBaseConverter
  * there are too many functions on the PDSPAnalizerConverter that the user does not need. The intermediante class would make it easier for the user.

- remove obsolete converters

- think about versioning. For example issue a tag everytime we give a presentation
