- automatize CMakeList.txt:
   * NODEPHEADERS for MAC: i think this is only needed for LArSoftReader, currently not used
   * TENSORFLOW stuff
     -> I Think it would be good to have the opportunity of compiling HighLAND with and without tensorflow depending on what the analyzer wants to do (flag variable on CMakeList?)
     -> solution based on the existence of the folder /cvmfs/larsoft.opensciencegrid.org/

- create a pdBaseConverter
  * there are too many functions on the PDSPAnalizerConverter that the user does not need. The intermediante class would make it easier for the user.

- remove obsolete converters

- DO you need to add several MiniTreeConverters depending on the location of the MiniTree inside the root file ?

- think about versioning. For example issue a tag everytime we give a presentation

- dependencies of packages and impact on parameters files

- Review ToyBoxPD
  * DaughterDistanceToVertex not used anymore in pionSelection. To be removed from ToyBoxPD => removed
  * Move Candidates from ToyBoxPD to ToyBoxKaon => moved
  * ToyBoxPD has a method called Reset that does exactly the same as the ToyBoxB class. I have copied equally to ToyBoxPD. Is it needed?

- Review EventBoxPD

- Review cut indices in the header file of the selections. They are not currently used

- AnaDetectorInfoPD in pdDataClasses not used => removed

- Shall we clean up the pdDataClasses using forward declarations and explain a little bit about them so the user can understand the different relations?

- Review pdSystematics
  * CNNVariation  
  * HitVariation
  * LengthVariation

- Review pdCorrections
  * BeamMomSmearingCorrection: seedValue
  * dEdxCorrection: obsolete ?
  * dEdxDataCorrection: obsolete ?
